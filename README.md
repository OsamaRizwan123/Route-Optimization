# Route-Optimization
A comparative study between Heuristic Algorithm and Brute Force Algorithm to solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

### Abstract
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a crucial problem that got associated with NP-hard problem by Karp in 1972 at the early stages of development of NP-completeness theory (Michael JÃ¼nger, 1995). The TSP is a wellknown algorithmic problem that resides in the domain of operations research & computer science studies. It primarily focuses upon finding the shortest yet most optimum route for a salesman to take given a set of locations (Ma, 2020). This paper presents a comparative study between two core algorithms for instance Brute Force Algorithm & Heuristic Approach (Genetic Algorithm) on the real-life data points made available by Retailo Technologies and highlight the implementation of the most efficient algorithm to find the shortest yet most efficient route to travel within a city.
